<h2>Nurturing the rolodex: how does distance affect acquisitions?</h2>

<div class="post">
<p><img src="/images/unsplash.com-bridge.jpg" alt="meeting"></p>

<p>One thing, which Ben Horowitz covers in his new book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Hard-Thing-About-Things/dp/0062273205">The Hard Thing about Hard Things</a> (it’s excellent, by the way) is that A16Z explicitly set out from the outset to cultivate relationships with large companies simply because, well, someone has to buy startups. I’ve seen very little information about how startups can cultivate relationships at actively acquisitive companies, but I think it’s a very important point. In other words, we might ask, how active should startup founders be in developing those connections?</p>

<!-- end_excerpt -->

<p>As a first step, I pulled together some data from Crunchbase to see how geographic location affects acquisition activity. I’m essentially using physical distance as a proxy for the quality of the connection between the acquirer and the acquired. I think it’s safe to assume that the closer two companies are together the more likely they are to have professional network and culture overlaps. </p>

<p><img src="/images/acquisitions-by-distance.jpg" alt="chart1"></p>

<p>It’s pretty clear that a large number of acquisitions happen between two companies that are physically close to each other, effectively within the same metropolitan area. This drops off pretty quickly, and only begins to recover at the very largest distances, indicating that there are a good number of cross-coastal deals taking place.</p>

<p><img src="/images/acquisitions-by-distance-percentage.jpg" alt="chart2"></p>

<p>If we look at it another way, we’ll see that roughly 30% of all deals happen within the same metropolitan area, but the majority of all deals happen outside of a company’s immediate geographical area.</p>

<p>Unsurprisingly, this is weighted heavily by city-based activity, but an important takeaway is that a large proportion of deals happen outside of those cities - a pretty good reason to start working that rolodex with strategically synergistic companies.</p>

<p>Of course, it’s another good reason to set up headquarters in a city with a lot of activity, beyond the more common talent argument.</p>

<h3>Closing Thoughts</h3>

<p>I’m learning more and more that exits are not as binary as I previously thought. You hear things like “90% of startups fail,” but I’ve realized that this is a rather ambiguous statement. No two people will define failure the same way, but if we think for a second we’ll understand that closing up shop is clearly not the only course of action when the company’s management team decides it needs to create liquidity. I think most people would consider acqui-hires and asset purchase agreements in the “non-zero” category, however small the deal might be.</p>

<p>We talk a lot about valuation from when Box files their S-1 or when Facebook buys Oculus, but I’ve seen much less about how smaller teams and less developed companies can maximize the outcome of their efforts. It seems to me that developing a personal relationship with corporate and business development teams at larger tech companies is an excellent way to increase this chance.</p>
