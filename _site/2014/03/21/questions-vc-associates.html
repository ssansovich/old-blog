<p>It’s common sense that deals get done at the partner level. But that doesn’t mean deals need to start at the partner level. Paul Graham has said <a href="http://paulgraham.com/fr.html">not to waste time with associates</a>, and I concede that he has a point. It’s undoubtedly true, however, that associates facilitate deals, and a large number of successful firms rely on their associates’ outreach efforts to stimulate deal flow. The process will vary depending on the firm, but the associates are there for one reason: to help the partners get deals done.</p>

<p>A lot of articles cover what you should ask a VC to determine a good fit, alignment, and interest. That is not the purpose of this post. Instead, I’d like to provide a couple of pointers that will be helpful to ensure and evaluate whether the associate you’re talking to will be an effective communicator of your product, your vision, and your goals to the rest of the investment committee.</p>

<h3>What are a few things that get you excited about a company?</h3>

<p>This will help you get a sense of two things:</p>

<ol>
<li>What the firm as a whole values – since the associates will generally reflect what the senior members of the firm have been talking about lately or talk about consistently.</li>
<li>How the associates articulates those qualities.</li>
</ol>

<p>With this knowledge, you’ll be able to play a little conversational judo. You get a sense for what the associate tends to emphasize so you can cover those points in your talks and guide the associate to arrive at points that you believe are important.</p>

<p>Phrasing your question along these lines may help elicit a more emotional, forthright response, rather than a formulaic pseudo-answer.</p>

<h3>How familiar are you with this space?</h3>

<p>Take a couple of minutes to make sure they understand the context in which you operate. In other words, into what slice of the market are you inserting yourself or which one are you replacing?</p>

<p>Depending on where the associate falls on the spectrum of specialist to generalist, you’ll be better able to cover your bases and contextualize the conversations going forward.</p>

<h3>Can you play back to me what we just went over?</h3>

<p>It doesn’t hurt to make sure they can communicate clearly and succinctly what it is you are trying to build or solve. This also gives you another opportunity to cover important points that they might have missed.</p>

<p>You will want to coach them a bit – considering that you are the domain expert and they, well, are not. You want them to present the most compelling points. If they cannot do this effectively and especially if they cannot do it at all, your message will be dead on arrival. Not good.</p>

<h3>What is your working relationship like with your partners?</h3>

<p>You want to understand two things: 1) the firm’s investment process and 2) the firm’s advisory and support relationships the companies it’s invested in. Depending on the size, structure, and mindset of the firm you’re talking to, these answers will change dramatically. Does the firm have a hands on or hands off approach? Depending on how you want your working relationship with your VCs to develop, you can use the associate’s answers to guide your understanding.</p>

<h3>Wrap Up</h3>

<p>In general, VC associates are aligned, incentivized, and busting-ass to find great companies to invest in. By acknowledging this and embracing the experience gap, you can create evangelists for your vision. Leveraging associates alone won’t close a round, but it can ensure your deal won’t fall flat at the next investment committee meeting.</p>
