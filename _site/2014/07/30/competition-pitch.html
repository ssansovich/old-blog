<h2>The Other Team: How to talk about the competition in a pitch</h2>

<div class="post">
<p><img src="/images/goboard.jpg" alt="meeting"></p>

<p>Why do so few founders talk about the competition in their pitches? I&#39;m not talking about the unispired &quot;magic quadrant&quot; slide. I&#39;m talking about honest and informed engagement with what the other players are working with. I&#39;m going to try to convince you to talk about the competition - a lot.</p>

<!-- end_excerpt -->

<h3>The elephant in the room</h3>

<p>I feel that not talking about the competition is actually a huge missed opportunity. Founders have the chance to foster a well-informed and nuanced discussion around the competition. These conversations, I believe, trend favorably compared to discussions that occur when investors are left to their own devices.</p>

<p>I’ve observed that by using a well-known (often incumbent) competitor or product as a starting point, experienced founders quickly and clearly convey how their product is different, better, or the same. Sometimes, especially with entrepreneurs building enterprise software, the end user plays a specific and well-defined role with an established workflow. By explaining how your products will fit into or change the existing model, you can more quickly and more easily explain what your product does.</p>

<h3>Use the competition as a starting point</h3>

<p>Instead, be direct by positioning your product in relationship to existing products. These relationships are either antagonistic or juxtapositional. If it’s antagonistic, you’re communicating a trade-off or directly addressing an issue. You’re saying, “ACME is bad. We’re fixing that.” If it’s juxtapositional, you’re saying, “ACME does A and B. We also do B but are introducing C.”</p>

<p>Like the pieces on a Go board, the competition represents all the areas of the grid that are currently taken. It’s your job to show which spaces are open and why there’s room to expand given the current set up.</p>

<p>This tactic reinforces a number of things for you:</p>

<ol>
<li>The customer&#39;s problem</li>
<li>Who buys your product and who uses it (they&#39;re often different people!)</li>
<li>The market trends opportunities</li>
<li>The status quo</li>
<li>Feature gaps</li>
</ol>

<p>It&#39;s similar to saying something like &quot;We&#39;re Uber but for...&quot; You cover a lot of ground with less cognitive overhead because people are familiar with that product.</p>

<h3>Educate the person across the table</h3>

<p>The reality is that all VCs think about the competitive landscape. By addressing their questions preemptively, you can guide them in their thinking with the correct conceptual frameworks and information.</p>

<p>Reid Hoffman explains two key points on <a href="http://reidhoffman.org/linkedin-pitch-to-greylock/">this topic</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Entrepreneurs often say they have no competition, assuming that’s an impressive claim. But if you claim that you don’t have competition, you either believe the market is completely inefficient or no one else thinks your space is valuable. Both are folly.</p>

<p>The market is efficient, eventually — if a valuable opportunity emerges, others will discover it. To build credibility with investors, you want to show that you understand the competitive risks and show why you’re going to win.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The last part is important. You, as the domain expert, can provide a conceptual framework of things that customers value. This might be power vs. ease-of-use, specific vs. general, customizable vs. standardized, etc.</p>

<p>Use this chance to explain specifically what you’ve built and why you think it’s better. VCs will inevitably do their own research, which will of course drum up questions that you may or may not have a chance to address.</p>

<p>By guiding their thinking, you can set yourself up for success. Show your knowledge of the space, convince your audience that you’ve done your homework and are confident in your solution. That confidence will be contagious.</p>
