    <blockquote>
<p>“We should appreciate what we are doing. There is no preparation for something else.”</p>

<blockquote>
<p>― Shunryu Suzuki, ZEN MIND, BEGINNER&#39;S MIND</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>The first notable programming project of Bill Gates, who started coding on a block of GE computer time when he was in eighth grade, was tic-tac-toe. Now, this wasn’t particularly novel (the first game of tic-tac-toe on a computer was programmed in 1951), and I doubt it had much of a chance of being lucrative. The important thing (for all of us), though, is that building this game delighted him enough to keep him interested. &quot;There was just something neat about the machine,&quot; Gates reflected. He later noted, “it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success.” That is a profound insight. Those little coding projects, however simple they might seem, were outright successes to young Gates, enough to motivate him to continue learning.</p>

<p>My experience, however, was more frustrating. I had dabbled with basic web development as a kid, and even at 13 or 14, I realized that my ideas ended up working and looking like total crap. So I gave it up for a while. I was a 19-year-old university student when I first started to learn to code, for real this time, in David Malan’s widely known and widely reminisced intro to computer science course. The first assignment was to build something – pretty much anything – with an application called <a href="scratch.mit.edu">Scratch</a>, which was built to teach basic computer science concepts to children, all without writing a single line of code.</p>

<p>Ultimately, that first assignment sparked an initial interest in building things on the computer for me and around 200 other students, most of whom had never coded before and thought the idea of learning to code was daunting [1]. Since then, the course has ballooned to over 500 students per year, generated countless projects and probably a handful of companies. That first project provided us with an easy win. It was something that we could all succeed at – despite our skill levels. It, I believe, is an extremely important part of the equation that fuels the popularity of Malan’s class.</p>

<h3>Another angle</h3>

<p>Tim Ferriss, one of pop culture’s most famous autodidacts, makes this abundantly clear in his latest book, The Four Hour Chef. Tim is focus on one goal for his readers – all eagerly attempting to learn how to cook – to achieve easy wins. He knows that if he fails to provide early successes, his readers will become quickly frustrated and quit. His first recipe, just like Malan’s first homework assignment, is not necessarily optimized for utility but rather for likelihood of success.</p>

<h3>Application: Onboarding new hires</h3>

<p>Some very successful companies make it as easy as possible for new employees to chalk up that easy win. At Etsy, there is “<a href="http://codeascraft.com/2012/03/13/making-it-virtually-easy-to-deploy-on-day-one/">one hard and fast rule</a> for new Engineers on their first day: deploy to production”. Zach Holman explains that GitHub has gone to lengths to lower the barrier of <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/scaling-github-employees/">pushing code on day one</a>. He words it better than I can but the idea is to promote a culture of both efficiency and solidarity. They have intentionally worked towards building an experience that allows new hires to hit the ground running, cemented with a tangible easy win.</p>

<h3>Application: Onboarding Users</h3>

<p>After looking at <a href="http://www.useronboard.com/how-tumblr-onboards-new-users/">UserOnboard.com’s breakdown of tumblr’s user onboarding process</a>, I realized that the tumblr design team optimizes for the easy win as well. If you’ve signed up for tumblr in the last, say, 6 months, you’ll realize that they have done two things masterfully:</p>

<ol>
<li>Clearly defined the easy win: “Find blogs. Follow five.”</li>
<li>Dramatically reduced the friction for a new user to succeed.</li>
</ol>

<p>The “easy win” is to provide them with new content immediately. This quite obviously is much easier than expecting someone to write a blog post.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>In both of these cases, the feeling of success and satisfaction is what drives engagement. By focusing on the probability rather than the magnitude of a win, you increase the chance for success and give people a taste of what your product can deliver, whether it is a CS course, a book, or a webapp. Conversely, you reduce the risk of frustration, which is what ultimately drives churn. It’s an easy win-win.</p>

    <a href="/tech/2014/02/26/natgeo-whatsapp.html"><h2>The Next 1 Billion: Why Facebook Bought WhatsApp in two pictures</h2></a>
    <p>The Internet is abuzz with discussion about the WhatsApp acquisition. I doubt I am the first person to arrive at this thought, but I wanted to point out my hypothesis for why Facebook bought WhatsApp. With the Instagram acquisition (and the Snapchat offer), it was about access to people outside Facebook&#39;s evolving demographics. For Instagram/Snapchat, it was about young people. For WhatsApp, it was about those outside the &quot;developed world.&quot;</p>

<p>There are two points that form what I believe to be a compelling case:</p>

<h3>National Geographic&#39;s infographic of <a href="http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2011/03/age-of-man/map-interactive">World Income Mapped by Location</a></h3>

<p><img src="/images/natgeo-world-of-seven-billion.png" alt="National Geographic World of Seven Billion"></p>

<p>National Geographic put together an eye-opening collection of images about the state of development throughout the world. If I may bracket issues surrounding income inequality for just a moment, I&#39;d want to point out data about technology penetration on the fourth slide.</p>

<p>As you&#39;ll see, Internet adoption for the &quot;upper middle&quot; segment of the world&#39;s population (those with $3,946 to $12,195 in annual income) is at 29.9%. Remarkably, cell phone usage for that same group of people is an incredible 92%.</p>

<p>In other words, the de facto technology driving connectivity for this part of the world is the mobile phone &mdash; leapfrogging the PC, which lags at 11.9%.</p>

<h3>TextIt&#39;s blog about the <a href="http://blog.textit.in/your-path-to-a-$16b-exit-build-a-j2me-app">WhatsApp team building J2ME apps</a></h3>

<p><img src="/images/whatsapp-j2me.jpg" alt="WhatsApp TextIt J2ME"></p>

<p>TextIt explains:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Writing J2ME apps is no cakewalk. While Android developers might whine about having to support myriad resolutions and versions of the API, J2ME ends up being less a standard and more a series of rough guidelines. There is no shortcut, you just have to test on every device, each with its own unique bugs and idiosyncrasies. Building a high quality app aimed at J2ME is the very definition of shlep, it is incredibly time consuming, boring and frustrating work.</p>

<p>That was the genius of WhatsApp really, they recognized that messaging apps are all about network effects and instead of focusing on the comparatively small market of the &#39;developed world&#39;, instead targeted the other 3 billion people who don&#39;t have smartphones. And at that they have been supremely successful.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All that hard work will become less relevant over time (like anything), but let&#39;s take a guess at who will be there waiting with salivating mouths when they upgrade to Android.</p>

<h3>Facebook bought access to the next 1 billion</h3>

<p>It&#39;s a long-term play, considering that WhatsApp will operate under its own brand as a standalone team, but it seems that Facebook bought an access point for the users it cannot serve - those that currently do not have traditional Internet access.</p>

<p>It&#39;s clear too that Facebook now has usage data on an entirely different part of the world&#39;s population that it does not cover. Given WhatsApp already very large userbase, this gives them an incredible ability to determine where cellphone adoption is increasing, how OS adoption is changing, where cellular/wifi coverage is provided, among many other things. The insights are endless, I think, and will continually inform Facebook&#39;s global strategy over the long term.</p>

    <a href="/2014/02/20/study-cs.html"><h2>Why Everyone Should Study Computer Science</h2></a>
    <p>I imagine there is a strong positive correlation between those who chose to study a foreign language and those who to travel to places where the native language is not the one they studied in high school. In other words, I mean that exposure to a foreign language dramatically increases a person’s willingness to navigate a foreign culture.</p>

<p>Technology, to me, is no different. Studying computer science, formally or informally, is a fantastic way to overcome the fear of the unknown. I am always impressed by people who are confident enough to say, “I’ve never done that before, but I can take a look and try to figure it out.” Even if that person fails to fix the problem, he or she will likely take away something from the process: a better perspective on whatever problem she was trying to solve and the gratitude of the person she was trying to help.
Technology will change, but attitude in this respect does not.</p>

<p>Again, it’s not so much a matter of being able to talk about any given technological subject – although plenty of people manage to do that – but rather a facility and willingness to listen, to tinker, and to learn. The first taste of knowledge espouses confidence and curiosity. We see it in children all the time. This is something that I think we need to push hard for in a world where our interactions with technology are being relegated to taps and swipes. To be clear, I think that these abstractions are great, but they are still abstractions. They make technology feel less like technology, and most powerful and important design trends are successful for that reason.</p>

<p>Studying computer science, on the other hand, re-exposes the parts of the systems that we use every day. Just like studying a foreign language might help a student think about subtleties of the language they speak at home and with their friends. I learned more about my native language in Spanish class than I ever did in any of my English classes.</p>

<p>People ask me, “Should I take [insert intro CS course here]?” My answer is always an emphatic yes. I’m encouraged by all of the efforts out there to increase computer literacy and truly believe that there are extraordinary gains to be realized in the coming years as access to computer science education (and education in general) is democratized. All the power to you, autodidacts. At least, it sure looks like it’s headed that way.</p>
