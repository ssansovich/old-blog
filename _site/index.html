	    <p>It’s common sense that deals get done at the partner level. But that doesn’t mean deals need to start at the partner level. Paul Graham has said <a href="http://paulgraham.com/fr.html">not to waste time with associates</a>, and I concede that he has a point. It’s undoubtedly true, however, that associates facilitate deals, and a large number of successful firms rely on their associates’ outreach efforts to stimulate deal flow. The process will vary depending on the firm, but the associates are there for one reason: to help the partners get deals done.</p>

<p>The first notable programming project of Bill Gates, who started coding on a block of GE computer time when he was in eighth grade, was tic-tac-toe. Now, this wasn’t particularly novel (the first game of tic-tac-toe on a computer was programmed in 1951), and I doubt it had much of a chance of being lucrative. The important thing (for all of us), though, is that building this game delighted him enough to keep him interested. &quot;There was just something neat about the machine,&quot; Gates reflected. He later noted, “it was hard to tear myself away from a machine at which I could so unambiguously demonstrate success.” That is a profound insight. Those little coding projects, however simple they might seem, were outright successes to young Gates, enough to motivate him to continue learning.</p>

	    <p>The Internet is abuzz with discussion about the WhatsApp acquisition. I doubt I am the first person to arrive at this thought, but I wanted to point out my hypothesis for why Facebook bought WhatsApp. With the Instagram acquisition (and the Snapchat offer), it was about access to people outside Facebook&#39;s evolving demographics. For Instagram/Snapchat, it was about young people. For WhatsApp, it was about those outside the &quot;developed world.&quot;</p>

	    <a href="/2014/02/20/study-cs.html"><h2>Why Everyone Should Study Computer Science</h2></a>
	    <p>I imagine there is a strong positive correlation between those who chose to study a foreign language and those who to travel to places where the native language is not the one they studied in high school. In other words, I mean that exposure to a foreign language dramatically increases a person’s willingness to navigate a foreign culture.</p>
