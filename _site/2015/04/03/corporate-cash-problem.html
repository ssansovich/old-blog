<h2>Tech's $500 Billion Cash Problem</h2>

<div class="post">
<p><img src="/images/corporatecash/cash-header.jpg" alt="cash"></p>

<p>Corporate cash levels have been steadily – and quickly – rising since the 1980s. Companies in the S&amp;P 500 set a record in 2014 for the amount of cash held at $1.43 trillion (excluding financial institutions). Technology companies hold a large portion of this cash at over $500 billion <a href="https://www.moodys.com/research/Moodys-Technology-sector-continues-to-dominate-cash-rich-US-companies--PR_283344">[1]</a>, despite outsized levels of both R&amp;D investment and acquisition activity.</p>

<!-- end_excerpt -->

<p>Just four tech firms – Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Cisco – together have $345 billion in cash, which is roughly 23% of total corporate (non-financial non-utility) cash in the United States. Apple alone holds about $178 billion in cash, and it may surprise some to know that Apple’s internal asset management company is the biggest hedge fund in the world. <a href="http://www.zerohedge.com/news/2012-09-30/presenting-worlds-biggest-hedge-fund-you-have-never-heard">[2]</a></p>

<p>In a perfectly efficient system, cash is invested immediately into the areas that will maximize future cash flows. This tenet of Corporate Finance 101 implies than an accumulation of cash is 1) a symptom of inefficiencies in distributing/investing that cash, 2) the best “investment” at that time, or 3) some combination of these.</p>

<p>Why are companies – particularly technology companies – holding cash at record levels? What does this trend mean for the startup ecosystem and the technology space in general? What does it mean in the context of all of the recent “bubble talk?”</p>

<h3>A Macro View</h3>

<p>A study from Juan Sanchez and Emircan Yurdgul of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis provides an excellent review of corporate cash trends. I will summarize it, but if you are interested in this topic, I suggest <a href="https://www.stlouisfed.org/Publications/Regional-Economist/January-2013/Why-Are-Corporations-Holding-So-Much-Cash">reading the paper</a>.</p>

<h4>1. Aggregate cash levels are at an all time high.</h4>

</div></p>

<h4>2. The ratio of cash to net assets is also increasing (controls for firms entering/exiting the market).</h4>

</div></p>

<h4>3. Firms with high levels of R&amp;D expenditure are especially likely to hold “abnormal” levels of cash.</h4>

<p><img src="/images/corporatecash/st-louis-fed-fig-4.png" alt="fig4">

</div></p>

<p>Notably, the cash-to-asset ratio increased dramatically after 2000 and again after 2008, implying that increases in cash levels correlate with periods of macroeconomic uncertainty.</p>

<p>Two things might explain these jumps in cash levels. First, firms scale back investment in R&amp;D projects, which are by their very nature uncertain and can compound risk with the economic situation. Second, they become more conservative in their acquisition strategies, likely pressured by the financial sector as its confidence falls with the stock prices.</p>

<p>In a sense, high cash levels look like a lagging indicator of market downturns.</p>

<p>Finally, Sanchez and Yurdgul point out that a principle reason for cash accumulation is the burden of repatriation taxes. In times of limited foreign investment opportunity and increasing foreign income, cash is held overseas in order to avoid taxes that would need to be paid once the money is brought back into the US. We will touch upon this later.</p>

<h3>Factors at the company level</h3>

<p>How a company treats its cash can say a lot about how the company is managed operationally.
Jeff Bezos is well known as an advocate of the classical view of corporate finance and is unapologetic about Amazon’s anemic margins. The basic point is that Amazon will aggressively invest in projects that will maximize free cash flow on an absolute basis and rather than optimizing for near-term cash flow profitability on a relative basis.</p>

<p>He would likely agree that the day Amazon starts to unintentionally accumulate cash is the day that Amazon has lost its operational edge or has run out of good ideas. Bezos has said “I think frugality drives innovation, just like other constraints do. One of the only ways to get out of a tight box is to invent your way out.” In Amazon’s case, the austerity is just self-imposed.</p>

<p><br></p>

<p><img src="/images/corporatecash/corporate-cash-ratios.png" alt="ratios"></p>

<p><br></p>

<p>It turns out that Amazon does pretty well in practice. Amazon holds about $15 billion in cash and cash equivalents. That might seem like a lot, but compare this to the other tech giants - Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Cisco. When adjusted for net assets, Microsoft holds twice as much cash as Amazon. Google, Apple, and Cisco hold about three times as much. Amazon has been remarkably disciplined in its approach, and investors have responded with patience.</p>

<h3>Psychological factors</h3>

<p>At the same time, investors and managers can maintain confidence and patience for what seems to be the exact opposite reason.
Under Steve Jobs, Apple accumulated a huge reserve of cash. Despite this, by the time he left Apple in 2011, Jobs had not issued a single dividend since he took over Apple for the second time in 1997 <a href="http://investor.apple.com/dividends.cfm">[3]</a>, when Apple was facing bankruptcy.</p>

<p>“Cash gives us tremendous security and flexibility.” He explained, “When you take risks, it’s like jumping up in the air, and it’s nice to know the ground will be there when you land. We run our company conservatively from a financial point of view because you never know what opportunity is around the corner…We’re very fortunate that if we needed to acquire something we could write a check for it and not have to borrow money.”</p>

<p>Of course, in the fast moving technology market, the flexibility he mentions is very important. However, Apple’s cash reserves are far beyond that required for the vast majority of acquisitions.</p>

<p>Erica Ogg of GigaOm posits that Jobs’ position here originated from Apple’s close encounter with bankruptcy back in 1997. In fact, <a href="http://www.rhsmith.umd.edu/files/Documents/Departments/Finance/Dittmar.pdf">it’s been shown</a> that companies led by executives who lived through the Great Depression hold more cash than their peers. The same is also true for other types of financial hardships, both personal and organizational.</p>

<p>Given that technology companies account for such a large portion of the cash held in the S&amp;P 500, and that the managers of these companies have, in effectively every case, gone through both the DotCom crash and the 2008 recession, there’s likely some weight to the psychological argument within the technology space.</p>

<h3>Trust from the financial sectors</h3>

<p>Consider what happened when Tim Cook took over back in 2012. At the time, Apple was sitting on roughly $100 billion in cash. Investors were anxious about Cook’s ability to maintain Apple’s innovative culture, and they started pressuring him to loosen his grip on Apple’s cash reserve, signaling that they didn’t trust the new management as much as they did Jobs. He was reluctant at first but gave in. The company has since issued eleven dividends, though the company’s investors are much friendlier now that Tim Cook has showed that he can hold his own.</p>

<p>Compare this to what Yahoo has gone through. With dwindling confidence in the company’s ability to manage the inevitable windfall from Alibaba’s IPO (i.e., cash that should otherwise be used to fund development or acquisitions), activist investors famously pressured Yahoo to spin off its ownership in the Chinese behemoth. I suspect things would have unfolded differently if Mark Zuckerberg, Jeff Bezos, or Elon Musk were given the opportunity to manage the cash from liquidating some Alibaba shares.</p>

<h3>Death &amp; Taxes</h3>

<p>By far the biggest factor of cash accumulation is the repatriation tax. For those unfamiliar, a company doesn’t pay taxes on foreign profits until the cash is brought back into the country where it pays corporate taxes. Faced with the low interest rates and easy access to debt, businesses simply leave the cash overseas until they have a compelling reason to bring it back.</p>

<p>In 2012, Cisco reported that it had accumulated $41.3 billion in overseas cash. Cisco’s CEO John Chambers explained to CNBC, “This is where tax policy can determine where you grow and where you don’t.” <a href="http://www.cnbc.com/id/100830545">[c]</a> For a company known for its high M&amp;A activity, this lock up of cash has a powerful influence on their growth strategy.</p>

<p>In the same interview, Chambers noted that, dissatisfied with the speed the US government was considering a tax holiday, Cisco would begin to buy companies overseas, specifically the Asia-Pacific and European regions.</p>

<p>While this trend provides capital and incentives for companies in those regions, it limits the amount of capital that is recycled into the US economy to create jobs or acquire startups.</p>

<p>Previous tax holidays have had a strong effect on bringing dollars back into the US. In 2004, Congress allowed corporations to repatriate foreign cash at a 5.25% tax rate, significant compared to the 35% top corporate tax rate. In response, US businesses brought $362 billion back into the US economy.</p>

<h3>So what does this mean for startups?</h3>

<p>A period of profitability coupled with general good faith in the technology sector has increased both companies’ and investors’ willingness to hold large amounts of cash on their balance sheet. This means that there is a lot of opportunity for companies to purchase startups – indicating that the active acquisition behavior will not likely change anytime soon.</p>

<p>The reality is that corporate cash is tied up overseas, severely limiting the amount of cash that can be redeployed into the market. In other words, the repatriation tax is creating a 35% hurdle that technologies companies are not willing to clear. This in turn prevents them from operating like Bezos’ Amazonian ideal.</p>

<p>This should concern anyone who believes, like I do, in the power of the startup ecosystem to effect change in the markets and deploy technology through society.</p>

<p>It’s especially troubling when we consider the number of startups reaching unicorn valuation levels or beyond because there are simply not enough companies with the cash ready and available to acquire them. Of course, the companies can IPO, which may be an increasingly likely option if this cash remains abroad.</p>

<p><img src="/images/corporatecash/foreign-corporate-cash-top-10.png" alt="top10"></p>

<p></small></p>

<p>For these companies, the repatriation tax is a built-in premium, raising the total price a company must pay to acquire a startup (or conversely lowering the possible purchase price). For a company valued at $10B in its last fundraise, this is not an insignificant cost.</p>

<p>That said, it likely means that companies that are generating a lot of cash (like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Apple), bolstered by huge buffers of cash reserves, will be increasingly willing to make big bets on bold new technologies both to maximize potential market shares and to compete with each other. This perhaps will accelerate the speed to which new technologies like hardware or infrastructure might enter the markets – either through acquisition or internal development.</p>

<p>I have to believe, though, that investing through a very small portion of your actual earnings significantly cripples the rate at which these kinds of developments can occur. As the nature of projects like Google Fiber or Facebook’s Connectivity Lab begin to resemble public works, a policy supporting a tax holiday can tie together both pro-business interests and public services.</p>

<p>At the very least, these large amounts of cash can serve as a cushion if there is some market correction. Startup valuations may fall, but it may balance out with an increased acquisition velocity as the large tech companies take advantage of their cash stockpiles coupled with falling valuations. Investors that are not just financially but also strategically motivated – i.e., corporate development teams and corporate VCs – may enjoy deep pockets and increased power in the market as the traditional VCs dial back their enthusiasm.</p>
